This is the old repository containing the inputs of the [LAMMPS Tutorials](https://lammpstutorials.github.io/) webpage. Current inputs
are stored [here](https://github.com/lammpstutorials/lammpstutorials-inputs)

### List of tutorials:

* Lennard Jones binary fluid - simple molecular dynamics simulation
* Polymer in water - constant force applied to the 2 ends of the polymer (polyethylene glycol)
* Nanosheared electrolyte - electrolyte sheared by two walls and velocity profile measurement
* Graphene under deformation - longitudinal deformation of a small graphene sheet
* Breaking a carbon nanotube - carbon nanotube under extreme deformation with reactive force field
* Water adsorption in silica - adsorption of water in a silica crack using the grand canonical Monte Carlo method
* Simple free energy calculation - simple sampling of a free energy barrier using WHAM
* Adsorption of ethanol - free energy profile of ethanol near a solid surface
* Deforming silicon dioxide - using reaxff and deform a structure
